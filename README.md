# CapsRule
This project is an implementation of the paper "CapsRule: Explainable Deep Learning for Classifying Network Attacks" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10101859. CapsRule is an effective and efficient rule-based deep learning explanation framework dedicated to classifying network attacks. It extracts high-fidelity rules from the feed-forward capsule network that explain how an input sample is classified.

This project is implemented using Python and Tensorflow library.

The repository contains pre-propcessing, training, rule-extraction, rule validation, rule evaluation, and computing performance measure.

This repository contains the source code for the following research article. Please cite this article if you use the code.
