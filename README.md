# CapsRule
This is the implementation of CapsRule, an effective and efficient rule-based deep learning explanation method dedicated to classifying network attacks. It extracts high-fidelity rules from the feed-forward capsule network that explain how an input sample is classified.
This project is implemented using Python and Tensorflow library.
