# CapsRule
This project is an implementation of the paper "CapsRule: Explainable Deep Learning for Classifying Network Attacks". CapsRule is an effective and efficient rule-based deep learning explanation framework dedicated to classifying network attacks. It extracts high-fidelity rules from the feed-forward capsule network that explain how an input sample is classified.

This project is implemented using Python and Tensorflow library.

The repository contains pre-propcessing, training, rule-extraction, rule validation, rule evaluation, and computing performance measure.
